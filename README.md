# CSharpFundamentals- Each section outputs relevant examples and explanations to the console.

## Project Structure
- **Program.cs**: Contains the main logic and examples for each topic.
- **CSharpFundamentals.csproj**: Project configuration file targeting .NET 9.0 with additional settings like AOT compilation and Docker support.

## Key Features of the Project
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Enabled to promote safer code.
- **Implicit Usings**: Simplifies code by automatically including common namespaces.
- **AOT Compilation**: Configured for Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for improved performance.
- **Docker Support**: Includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment.

## Topics Covered
### 1. Primitive Types
- Demonstrates the use of `byte`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, `char`, `bool`, and `string`.
- Shows the range of numeric types using `MinValue` and `MaxValue`.

### 2. Type Conversion
- Implicit and explicit conversions.
- Safe parsing with `int.TryParse`.
- Use of the `Convert` class for type conversion.

### 3. Operators
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
- Ternary operator and null-coalescing operator.

### 4. Control Flow
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`).
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`).
- Flow control statements (`break`, `continue`).

### 5. Arrays
- Single-dimensional arrays.
- Multi-dimensional arrays.
- Jagged arrays.
